Growth is calculated from constant price GDP data in local currency. Sustained economic growth increases average incomes and is strongly linked to poverty reduction. GDP per capita provides a basic measure of the value of output per person, which is an indirect indicator of per capita income. Growth in GDP and GDP per capita are considered broad measures of economic growth.","Statistical Capacity Indicators","World Development Indicator (WDI) databank.

This indicator can be used to assess if the national government is actually funding education from its own sources, since it excludes transfers for education received by foreign donors. It is calculated by taking the total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure (current and capital) on education minus international transfers to government for education. When expressed as a share of GDP, initial government funding on education is divided by the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Limitations: In some instances data on total government expenditure on education refers only to the Ministry of Education, excluding other ministries which may also spend a part of their budget on educational activities. There are also cases where it may not be possible to separate international transfers to government from general government expenditure on education, in which cases they have not been subtracted in the formula.

"168","UIS.XGDP.FSHH.FFNTR","Initial household funding of education as a percentage of GDP","Total payments of households (pupils, students and their families) for educational institutions (such as for tuition fees, exam and registration fees, contribution to Parent-Teacher associations or other school funds, and fees for canteen, boarding and transport) and purchases outside of educational institutions (such as for uniforms, textbooks, teaching materials, or private classes). 'Initial funding' means that government transfers to households, such as scholarships and other financial aid for education, are subtracted from what is spent by households. Note that in some countries for some education levels, the value of this indicator may be 0, since on average households may be receiving as much, or more, in financial aid from the government than what they are spending on education. Calculation: Total payments of households (pupils, students and their families) for educational institutions (such as for tuition fees, exam and registration fees, contribution to Parent-Teacher associations or other school funds, and fees for canteen, boarding and transport), plus purchases outside of educational institutions (such as for uniforms, textbooks, teaching materials, or private classes), minus government education transfers to households (such as scholarships or other education-specific financial aid). This is then divided by the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Limitations: Indicators for household expenditure on education should be interpreted with caution since data comes from household surveys which may not all follow the same definitions and concepts. These types of surveys are also not carried out in all countries with regularity, and for some categories (such as pupils in pre-primary education), the sample sizes may be low. In some cases where data on government transfers to households (scholarships and other financial aid) was not available, they could not be subtracted from amounts paid by households.

Calculation Method: Total general (local, regional and central) government expenditure (current and capital) on a given level of education (primary, secondary, etc) minus international transfers to government for education, divided by the number of student enrolled at that level of education. This is then expressed as a share of GDP per capita.
